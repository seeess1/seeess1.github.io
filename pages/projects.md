# Data engineering

Up until September 2020, I was a data engineer at a Brooklyn-based startup called [Topos](https://topos.com/). Topos specialized in making maps (like the one above - our [COVID-19 tracker](https://covid19.topos.com/)). We made maps to help owners of small retail chains find the best neighborhood to expand into:

Or maps to help New Yorkers find a place to get a drink outside:

We worked with all kinds of data: demographic stats from the US Census, metadata for every businesses across the country, the average traffic volume of every road segment at every hour of the day for the entire US, restaurant menus and reviews, and a lot more. My job as a data engineer was to collect all the data, clean it, and generate new metrics for our data science and front end teams.

# Data analysis

When I wasn't ingesting/transforming large data sets at Topos, I did my own analysis on topics like the number of new businesses opened weekly in each state this year (as another way to understand the economic impact of COVID-19):

Or looking at communities in the American Southwest that are particularly vulnerable to public health crises:

# Data science

But before Topos, I cut my teeth with data engineering, mapping, and data science at NYU in an [applied data science program](https://cusp.nyu.edu/) where we learned how to apply machine learning modules in Python. Projects included: [anomoly detection in traffic data](https://github.com/seeess1/machineLearning/blob/master/anomalies_traffic_health.ipynb), using computer vision to [count pedestrian traffic at an intersection on campus](https://github.com/seeess1/pedestrian_cv), and analyzing the [relationship between bars and 311 complaints](https://github.com/seeess1/publicDrunkenness/blob/master/public_drunkenness.ipynb).
