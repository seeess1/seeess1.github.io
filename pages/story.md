# Throughline

I'm an analyst who can also step in and organize teams/projects.

## Timeline

In 2012, I started analyzing data in different capacities:

1. 2012-2013: Research assistant for a medical study 
2. 2013-2016: Analyst at the Manhattan DA's Office (investigating city officials suspected of criminal activity)
3. 2016-2017: Investigator for PI firm (background checks, legal defense, witness interviews)
4. 2017-2018: Auditor for NYC Campaign Finance Board (checking the flow of money in and out of local NYC political campaigns to make sure things checked out)

During this last one as an auditor, I started learning Python and SQL on the side in my spare time. This is where I made the deep dive into quantitative data by enrolling at NYU:

5. 2018-2019: Applied data science masters at [NYU](https://cusp.nyu.edu/) with a focus on the intersection between urban planning and open data (aka how can we use data to understand/improve cities?)
6. 2019-2020: Data Engineer at [Topos](https://topos.com/) - a Brooklyn-based startup focused on understanding cities through data and passing along that understanding to retail chains looking to grow

In sum, I'm an analyst who likes data of all kinds - that's what's been tugging me along this path over the past 8 years.

## The other half

Aka tennis. Right now I'm helping direct a non-profit in Brooklyn called the [Fort Greene Tennis Association](http://www.fortgreenetennis.org/), which (you guessed it) manages all things tennis at Fort Greene Park in Brooklyn, NY. Been a board member there since 2015 and we've done things like raise $70k to resurface the courts in 2019, put on events for hundreds of people, manage a mailing list of 1k+ rabid tennis fans, plus I do the occassional [data analysis](./side-projects.md). (This is the team/project organization side of my brain.)

## A couple funny stories

Before I got on the data analyst track, I lived a few different lives: I taught English in China for a year, harvested vegetables on a farm in Vermont for a season, drove a delivery truck for an UWS bakery (the one with the very, very large cookies), and taught tennis on a roof in Chelsea.

Glad I did it. Glad I'm not doing it now.
