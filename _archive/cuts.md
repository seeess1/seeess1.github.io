## Timeline

In 2012, I started analyzing data in different capacities:

1. 2012-2013: Research assistant for a medical study 
2. 2013-2016: Analyst at the Manhattan DA's Office (investigating city officials suspected of criminal activity)
3. 2016-2017: Investigator for PI firm (background checks, legal defense, witness interviews)
4. 2017-2018: Auditor for NYC Campaign Finance Board (checking the flow of money in and out of local NYC political campaigns to make sure things checked out)

2012-2018: Rsearch assistant, investigative analyst, then investigator, then auditor (in that order). 

During this last one as an auditor, I started learning Python and SQL on the side in my spare time. This is where I made the deep dive into quantitative data by enrolling at NYU:

5. 2018-2019: Applied data science masters at [NYU](https://cusp.nyu.edu/) with a focus on the intersection between urban planning and open data (aka how can we use data to understand/improve cities?)
6. 2019-2020: Data Engineer at [Topos](https://topos.com/) - a Brooklyn-based startup focused on understanding cities through data and passing along that understanding to retail chains looking to grow

In sum, I'm an analyst who likes data of all kinds - that's what's been tugging me along this path over the past 8 years.
