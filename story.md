## tl;dr

I'm an analyst who can also organize teams/projects.

## The analyst part

Between 2013 and 2018, my career revolved around analyzing qualitative data in the legal-investigative world. I started out as an analyst at the [Manhattan DA's Office](https://www.manhattanda.org/district-attorney-vance-announces-expansion-anti-corruption-unit/) investigating city officials suspected of criminal activity. Then I moved over to the private sector as an investigator for a small [PI firm](https://www.questinvestigates.com/) where we did background checks, interviewed witnesses, and read lots of court cases. Finally, I moved back to the public sector as an auditor for the [NYC Campaign Finance Board](https://www.nyccfb.info/).

During that last one (auditing), I started to make the switch from from qualitative to quantitative analysis. In my spare time, I learned basic Python and SQL until I decided to get serious and go full time. So I enrolled in an applied data science masters program at [NYU](https://cusp.nyu.edu/) in the summer of 2018. 

Our program focused on the intersection between urban planning and open data (aka how can we use data to understand/improve cities?), which helped me transition to [Topos](https://topos.com/), a Brooklyn-based startup that used data to understand cities and share our insights with retail chains looking to expand. I was a data engineer at Topos and you can find out more about my work for them at [this link](./projects.md).

In sum, I'm an analyst who likes data of all kinds and that's what's been tugging me along this path over the past 7 years.

## The organizational part

Since 2015, I've been helping to run a non-profit in Brooklyn called the [Fort Greene Tennis Association](http://www.fortgreenetennis.org/), which (you guessed it) manages all things tennis at Fort Greene Park in Brooklyn, NY. Since I became a board member, we've done things like raise $70k to resurface the courts in 2019, put on events for hundreds of people, manage a mailing list of 1k+ rabid tennis fans, plus I do the occassional [data analysis](./side-projects.md).

This is the team/project organization side of my brain.

## Last thing

Prior to data analysis and non-profit work, I lived a few different lives: I taught English in China for a year, harvested vegetables on a farm in Vermont for a season, drove a delivery truck for an UWS bakery (the one with the very, very large cookies), and taught tennis on a roof in Chelsea.

Glad I did it. Glad I'm not doing it now.
