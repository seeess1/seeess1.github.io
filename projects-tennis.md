# Data + tennis

I've done side projects combining tennis and data to help out with our non-profit work at the [Fort Greene Tennis Association](http://www.fortgreenetennis.org/) and just for the hell of it. 

The map at the top was the result 

Every now and then I find a way to combine programming with my interest in tennis. That combo has manifested itself in a few different ways, including [this website I created](https://www.bageled.nyc/) and this [map of tennis and handball courts in NYC](http://www.fortgreenetennis.org/nyc-courts). If you're particularly interested in my work with data & tennis, there's more of that [in here](./pages/tennis.md).
