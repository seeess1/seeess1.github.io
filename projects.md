<h1>Data engineering</h1>

Up until September 2020, I was a data engineer at a Brooklyn-based startup called [Topos](https://topos.com/), where we specialized in making maps. 
<br>
<br>
To make our maps, we needed lots of data: demographic stats from the Census, business metadata, vehicular traffic counts, restaurant reviews, and much more. My job was to collect all the data, clean and transform it, and make it ready to serve as the backbone for our applications. Here are a couple snapshots from Topos projects featuring the data I wrangled:
<br>

<h3>COVID-19 Compiler</h3>
In Spring 2020 we built a [COVID-19 tracker](https://covid19.topos.com/), which lets users explore different ways to measure COVID-19 cases in the US:

And then layer demographic stats (like population, unemployment numbers, and housing density) on top of case counts to look for interesting overlaps:

<br>
<br>
### Retail
We also helped retailers decide how to grow their business by making maps like this one, which finds similar neighborhoods across cities based on machine learning models:

### Cocktails To Go
And we even made maps for New Yorkers looking for [a place to get a drink outside](https://cocktails.topos.com/):

# Data analysis

When I wasn't transforming large data sets, I did my own analysis for Topos on topics like [trends in job postings nationwide](https://twitter.com/topos_ai/status/1258184297732849666) following the onset of COVID-19. Or looking at communities in the American Southwest that are particularly vulnerable to [public health crises](https://medium.com/topos-ai/high-covid-19-vulnerability-seen-in-and-near-navajo-nation-and-hopi-reservation-in-arizona-edba321699cb):

# Data science

And before joining Topos, I cut my teeth with data engineering, mapping, and analysis at NYU in an [applied data science program](https://cusp.nyu.edu/). My projects included: 
* [Anomaly detection](https://github.com/seeess1/machineLearning/blob/master/anomalies_traffic_health.ipynb) in traffic data
* Analyzing the relationship between [bars and 311 complaints](https://github.com/seeess1/publicDrunkenness/blob/master/public_drunkenness.ipynb)
* [Using computer vision](https://github.com/seeess1/pedestrian_cv) to count pedestrians at an intersection on campus:

Plus exercises in [streaming big data](https://github.com/seeess1/bigData) and more [machine learning](https://github.com/seeess1/machineLearning).

# Data + tennis

I also look for ways to combine programming with my non-profit work and general interest in tennis. You can learn more about those projects [here](./projects-tennis.md).
