<h1>Data engineering</h1>

I got into the data engineering game five years ago and have worked with demographic, geospatial, retail, healthcare, and sports data.
<br>
<br>
My first data engineering role was at a Brooklyn-based startup called [Topos](https://topos.com/), where we specialized in making maps. To make our maps, we needed lots of data: demographic stats from the Census, business metadata, vehicular traffic counts, restaurant reviews, and much more. The data I collected, cleaned, and transformed served as the backbone for our applications, including...
<br>
<br>
<h2>COVID-19 Compiler</h2>
In Spring 2020 we built a [COVID-19 tracker](https://covid19.topos.com/), which let users explore different ways to measure COVID-19 cases in the US:

<div class="w3-container">
  <img src="./assets/images/cases.gif" style="width:100%;cursor:zoom-in"
  onclick="document.getElementById('modal01').style.display='block'">
  <div id="modal01" class="w3-modal" onclick="this.style.display='none'">
    <span class="w3-button w3-hover-yellow w3-xlarge w3-display-topright">X</span>
    <div class="w3-modal-content w3-animate-zoom">
      <img src="./assets/images/cases.gif" style="width:100%">
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
<br>

It also let users layer demographic stats (like population, unemployment numbers, and housing density) on top of case counts to look for interesting overlaps:

<div class="w3-container">
  <img src="./assets/images/layers.gif" style="width:100%;cursor:zoom-in"
  onclick="document.getElementById('modal02').style.display='block'">
  <div id="modal02" class="w3-modal" onclick="this.style.display='none'">
    <span class="w3-button w3-hover-yellow w3-xlarge w3-display-topright">X</span>
    <div class="w3-modal-content w3-animate-zoom">
      <img src="./assets/images/layers.gif" style="width:100%">
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
<br>

## Retail

We worked with retailers by making maps like this one to help them find the best spot in any US city to open a new store (based on machine learning models):

<div class="w3-container">
  <img src="./assets/images/neighborhoods.gif" style="width:100%;cursor:zoom-in"
  onclick="document.getElementById('modal03').style.display='block'">
  <div id="modal03" class="w3-modal" onclick="this.style.display='none'">
    <span class="w3-button w3-hover-yellow w3-xlarge w3-display-topright">X</span>
    <div class="w3-modal-content w3-animate-zoom">
      <img src="./assets/images/neighborhoods.gif" style="width:100%">
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
<br>
<br>
<br>
## Cocktails To Go

And we even made maps for New Yorkers looking for [a place to get a drink outside](https://cocktails.topos.com/) in Summer 2020:

<div class="w3-container">
  <img src="./assets/images/cocktails-smartphone.png" style="width:100%;cursor:zoom-in"
  onclick="document.getElementById('modal04').style.display='block'">
  <div id="modal04" class="w3-modal" onclick="this.style.display='none'">
    <span class="w3-button w3-hover-yellow w3-xlarge w3-display-topright">X</span>
    <div class="w3-modal-content w3-animate-zoom">
      <img src="./assets/images/cocktails-smartphone.png" style="width:100%">
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
<br>
<br>
<br>

# Data analysis

When I wasn't transforming large data sets, I did my own analysis for Topos on topics like [trends in job postings nationwide](https://twitter.com/topos_ai/status/1258184297732849666) following the onset of COVID-19. Or looking at communities in the American Southwest that are particularly vulnerable to [public health crises](https://medium.com/topos-ai/high-covid-19-vulnerability-seen-in-and-near-navajo-nation-and-hopi-reservation-in-arizona-edba321699cb):

<div class="w3-container">
  <img src="./assets/images/reservations.png" style="width:100%;cursor:zoom-in"
  onclick="document.getElementById('modal05').style.display='block'">
  <div id="modal05" class="w3-modal" onclick="this.style.display='none'">
    <span class="w3-button w3-hover-yellow w3-xlarge w3-display-topright">X</span>
    <div class="w3-modal-content w3-animate-zoom">
      <img src="./assets/images/reservations.png" style="width:100%">
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
<br>

# Data science

And before joining Topos, I cut my teeth with data engineering, mapping, and analysis at NYU in an [applied data science program](https://cusp.nyu.edu/). My projects included: 
* [Anomaly detection](https://github.com/seeess1/machineLearning/blob/master/anomalies_traffic_health.ipynb) in traffic data
* Analyzing the relationship between [bars and 311 complaints](https://github.com/seeess1/publicDrunkenness/blob/master/public_drunkenness.ipynb)
* [LiDAR mapping](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/nyu-cusp-lidar-exercise-a5b41ceffb5f47f8a9c11123de2f20ea)
* [Using computer vision](https://github.com/seeess1/pedestrian_cv) to count pedestrians at an intersection on campus:
<br>
<div class="w3-container">
  <img src="./assets/images/pedestrians.png" style="width:100%;cursor:zoom-in"
  onclick="document.getElementById('modal06').style.display='block'">
  <div id="modal06" class="w3-modal" onclick="this.style.display='none'">
    <span class="w3-button w3-hover-yellow w3-xlarge w3-display-topright">X</span>
    <div class="w3-modal-content w3-animate-zoom">
      <img src="./assets/images/pedestrians.png" style="width:100%">
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
<br>

Plus exercises in [streaming big data](https://github.com/seeess1/bigData) and more [machine learning](https://github.com/seeess1/machineLearning).

# Data + tennis

As a Data Engineer at Universal Tennis, I've finally found a way to combine my work with tennis. I build pipelines to keep our player ratings up to date and manage our data engineering team. But I've also worked on a few personal projects, which you can see <a href="./data-and-tennis">here</a>.
