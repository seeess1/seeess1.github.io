# Past lives

So teaching English, bakery, private investigators, yada yada yada...

Basically, I took some time to try other walks of life but eventually figured out that I like analyzing data. 

I took a year after college to live abroad and teach English in China. I came back and wanted to keep exploring, which landed me on the farm in Vermont. Exploring continues and I find myself in NYC where I take any job I can get (aka the bakery plus teaching tennis) and eventually land a spot as an investigative analyst at the Manhattan DA's Office, where we were looking into city officials suspected of criminal activity. I continued down that investigative path at the PI firm and then back with the City at the Campaign Finance Board, where we were focused specifically on keeping tabs on money going in and out of local NYC political campaigns.

In that last position, I started learning to code on the side. I liked it, figured out it was the right thing for me to keep doing, and decided to enroll at NYU in an applied data science program. That led me to the Data Engineer role at Topos and the rest is history.
