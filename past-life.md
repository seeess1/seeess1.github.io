# How does all of that square?

So as I was saying, 

The answer? I took some time to try other walks of life but eventually figured out that I like analyzing data. 

I took a year after college to live abroad and teach English in China. I came back and wanted to keep exploring, which landed me on the farm in Vermont. Exploring continues and I find myself in NYC where I take any job I can get (aka the bakery plus teaching tennis) and eventually land a spot as a investigative analyst at the Manhattan DA's Office, where we were looking into city officials suspected of criminal activity. I continued down that investigative path at the PI firm and then back with the City at the Campaign Finance Board.

In that last position, I started learning to code on the side. I liked it 

My main jobs before getting into data engineering were in investigations. 

Plus I really just like tennis ()
