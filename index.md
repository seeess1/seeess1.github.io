# Projects

I'm a data engineer living in Brooklyn, NY and I like Python, SQL, and maps (plus the occassional web development - like this website, for example). Take a look at some of my projects <a href="./portfolio-data">here</a>.

I also happen to be very into tennis and have combined tennis with data in <a href="./portfolio-tennis">some interesting ways</a>.

# About

The short version: I'm an analyst who can also organize teams and projects.

The longer version: Along with data engineering and analysis, I'm also a board member at a non-profit in Brooklyn, where I work with other members of the community to put on events, raise money, and build connections with like-minded groups. I explain the non-code stuff <a href="./bio">here</a>.
