# What is this and why? 

A simple website to help you understand who Sam Burns is, what he knows how to do, and what he's interested in. 

GitHub + LinkedIn = an incomplete picture. I'm hoping this fills in some of the gaps through a combination of text and examples from past projects.

# What I do/know how to do

Mainly two things: 1) I'm a data engineer (more on that [here](./data.md) and [here](./side-projects.md)); 

and 2) I'm on the board at a non-profit in Brooklyn, NY (more on that [here](./non-profit.md)). 

Plus...

# What I did before

Before data engineering and non-profit work but since I finished college in 2010, I've lived a few different lives: I taught English in China for a year, harvested vegetables on a farm in Vermont for a season, moved to NYC, drove a delivery truck for an UWS bakery (the one with the very, very large cookies), and worked for a pair of private investigators (it's not quite as sexy as it sounds but some of it's pretty interesting).

More on all of that [here](./past-life.md).

# So what's the throughline?

I'm a data geek who took his time to try out other ways of living but I've found my way to where I need to be, which is, apparently, behind a computer screen writing Python, SQL, and, every now and then, some prose.

And I also happen to like tennis.
