# Projects

I'm a data engineer living in Brooklyn, NY and I like Python, SQL, and maps (plus the occassional web development - like this website, for example). My projects include this COVID-19 tracker <a href="./projects">and more</a>:

I also happen to be very into tennis and have combined tennis with data in <a href="./data-and-tennis">some interesting ways</a>:

# About

The short version: I'm an analyst who can also organize teams and projects.

The longer version: Along with data engineering and analysis, I'm also a board member at a non-profit in Brooklyn, where I work with other members of the community to put on events, raise money, and build connections with like-minded groups. I explain the non-code stuff <a href="./bio">here</a>.
