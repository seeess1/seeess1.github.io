<h1>Intro</h1>

I live in Brooklyn, NY and I'm a data engineer (half 1) who can also organize teams and projects (half 2).
<br>
<br>
<h2>The first half</h2>

I like Python, SQL, and maps (plus the occassional web development - like this website, for example).

<h3><a href="./projects">Projects</a></h3>

Many of <a href="./projects">my projects</a> center around making maps using geospatial data, like this COVID-19 tracker:

<br>
<br>
<h3><a href="./data-and-tennis">Data + tennis</a></h3>

But I'm also in a long-term, committed relationship with tennis and I've <a href="./data-and-tennis">found ways</a> to combine that with data:

<h2>The second half</h2>

Along with data engineering and analysis, I'm also a board member at a non-profit in Brooklyn, where I work with other members of the community to put on events, raise money, and build connections with like-minded groups. I explain the two halves in more detail <a href="./bio">here</a>.
