# Projects

I'm a data engineer living in Brooklyn, NY and I like Python, SQL, and maps (plus the occassional web development - like this website, for example). Take a look at some of my projects [here](./projects.md).

I also happen to be very into tennis and have found ways to combine tennis with data in [a few different ways](./projects-tennis.md).

# About

The short version: I'm an analyst who can also organize teams/projects.

The longer version: Along with data engineering and analysis, I'm also a board member at a non-profit in Brooklyn, where I work with other members of the community to put on events, raise money, and build connections with like-minded groups. I explain more about that and how I got into the data world [here](./story.md).
