# What is this? 

A simple website to help you understand who Sam Burns is, what he knows how to do, and what he's interested in. 

# Why?

GitHub + LinkedIn = an incomplete picture. I'm hoping this fills in some of the gaps.

# What I do/know how to do

Mainly two things: 1) I'm a data engineer; and 2) I'm on the board at a non-profit in Brooklyn, NY.

# What I've done

 I've had a few different lives since I finished college in 2010. I taught English in China for a year, harvested vegetables on a farm in Vermont for a season, and then moved to NYC, where I've driven a delivery truck for an UWS bakery (the one with the very, very large cookies), taught tennis on the roof of a building in Chelsea, and worked for a pair of private investigators (it's not quite as sexy as it sounds but some of it *actually* is as sexy as it sounds).

# How does all of that square?

The answer? I took some time to try other jobs but eventually figured out that I like analyzing data. 

I took a year after college to live abroad and teach English in China. I came back and wanted to keep exploring, which landed me on the farm in Vermont. Exploring continues and I find myself in NYC 

My main jobs before getting into data engineering were in investigations. 

Plus I really just like tennis ()
