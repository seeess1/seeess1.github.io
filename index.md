<h1><a href="./projects">Projects</a></h1>

I'm a data engineer living in Brooklyn, NY and I like Python, SQL, and maps (plus the occassional web development - like this website, for example).

Many of <a href="./projects">my projects</a> center around geospatial data, like this COVID-19 tracker:

And I also <a href="./data-and-tennis">find ways</a> to combine data with my long-term, committed relationship with tennis:

<h1><a href="./bio">About</a></h1>

The short version: I'm an analyst who can also organize teams and projects.

The longer version: Along with data engineering and analysis, I'm also a board member at a non-profit in Brooklyn, where I work with other members of the community to put on events, raise money, and build connections with like-minded groups. I explain the non-code stuff <a href="./bio">here</a>.
