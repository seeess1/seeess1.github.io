# Projects

I'm a data engineer living in Brooklyn, NY and I like Python, SQL, and maps (plus the occassional web development - like this website, for example). [These are some of my projects](./projects.md).

<br>
I also happen to be very into tennis and have found ways to combine tennis with data in [a few different ways](./projects-tennis.md).

# About

The short version: I'm an analyst who can also organize teams/projects.

The longer version: Along with data engineering and analysis, I'm also a board member at a non-profit in Brooklyn. I explain more about that and how I got into the data world [here](./story.md).
