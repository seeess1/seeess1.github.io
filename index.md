# What is this and why? 

A simple website to help you understand who Sam Burns is, what he knows how to do, and what he's interested in. GitHub + LinkedIn = an incomplete picture. I'm hoping this fills in some of the gaps.

# What I do/know how to do

Mainly two things: 1) I'm a data engineer; and 2) I'm on the board at a non-profit in Brooklyn, NY. (Plus some other stuff - read below.)

My professional experience as a data engineer was with a Brooklyn-based startup called Topos ([more on that here](./data.md)). I also have [a few more side projects/hustles](./side-projects.md) related to data and web development.

I explain [more about my non-profit work here](./non-profit.md)

# What I've done

Before data engineering and non-profit work but since I finished college in 2010, I've lived a few different lives. I taught English in China for a year, harvested vegetables on a farm in Vermont for a season, and then moved to NYC, where I've driven a delivery truck for an UWS bakery (the one with the very, very large cookies), taught tennis on the roof of a building in Chelsea, and worked for a pair of private investigators (it's not quite as sexy as it sounds but some of it actually *is* as sexy as it sounds).

More on all of that [here](./past-life.md).
