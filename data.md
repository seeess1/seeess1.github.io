# Data engineering

Up until September 2020, I was a data engineer at a Brooklyn-based startup called Topos. At Topos, our goal was to help business owners figure out where to expand to. For example, let's say you own a couple bars in the Grant Park neighborhood of Atlanta, GA and you want to open a new location in an entirely new city: Chicago, IL. But you have no idea which part of Chicago would be the best place for your business. 

Enter Topos. We would give you ranked recommendations for specific sections of particular neighborhoods in Chicago where you'd be most likely to find your target market. And we'd do that by using data from a bunch of different places - like demographic stats from the US Census, the locations of all businesses across the country, vehicular traffic counts per hour per road segment for the entire US, restaurant reviews, and a lot more - and then feeding that data into our recommendation algorithm.

My job as a data engineer was to collect all the data feeding our algorithm, clean it, and generate new metrics from the raw data.
