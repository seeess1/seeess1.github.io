# Non-profit work

I've been playing tennis for as long as I can remember. My dad taught my brother and I how to play and it became a family sport. I played in high school and college and have stuck with it as an adult. And since I moved to NYC in December 2011, I got involved with the [Fort Greene Tennis Association](http://www.fortgreenetennis.org/), which (you guessed it) manages all things tennis at Fort Greene Park in Brooklyn, NY.

NYC Parks is chronically underfunded and tennis courts are low on the totem pole. So it's up to organizations like ours to maintain the courts, even when that maintenance is relatively intensive and costly. So I joined the FGTA board in 2015 because they needed extra help from new members (read: they had babies, I didn't).

We have an extremely dedicated community and between 2017 and 2019, I spearheaded our fundraising campaign, which raised more than $70,000 to resurface the 6 tennis courts at Fort Greene Park. Along the way, I've taken on additional projects for FGTA, including creating our website, organizing events, and ad hoc data analysis.
