# Bio

## Tl;dr

I was in the legal-investigative world in NYC for several years before I made the switch to data engineering/analysis/science. It was definitely the right call...

## The longer version

I got a degree in Philosophy from Davidson College in 2010 (where I was, sadly, not part of Steph Curry's inner circle), spent a year in China teaching English, and then moved to NYC. After a few odd jobs, I landed a job at the [Manhattan DA's Office](https://www.manhattanda.org/district-attorney-vance-announces-expansion-anti-corruption-unit/) investigating city officials suspected of public corruption. Then I moved over to a small [PI firm](https://www.questinvestigates.com/) as an investigator where we did background checks, interviewed witnesses, and read lots of court cases. Finally, I moved back to the public sector as an auditor for the [NYC Campaign Finance Board](https://www.nyccfb.info/).

During that last one (auditing), I started to make the switch from qualitative to quantitative analysis. In my spare time, I learned Python and SQL before deciding to go full time at an applied data science masters program at [NYU](https://cusp.nyu.edu/) in Summer 2018.

Since then, I've stayed on the data engineering path and have found a way to blend it together with tennis(!) in my current role as a Data Engineer at [Universal Tennis](https://www.universaltennis.com/).

## On the side...

From 2015 to 2023, I helped run the [Fort Greene Tennis Association](http://www.fortgreenetennis.org/). While I was a board member at FGTA, I:

- Led a fundraising drive in which we raised $70k and resurfaced all 6 tennis courts in 2019.
- Collected and analyzed data to create <a href="./data-and-tennis">maps and analytical insights</a>.
- And helped to put on events for hundreds of people (among many other things).

FGTA became a [nationally-recognized organization](https://www.usta.com/en/home/stay-current/national/fort-greene-park-tennis-hotbed-highlights-growth-of-recreational.html) and I'm really glad I got to be a part of it.
